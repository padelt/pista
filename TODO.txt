Redis:

Utilities:
	populate user , Acl for pista


all pages:
	height of page (scrollbar is visible)
	DONE: create mqttfunc() which subscribes (list of topics must be static to
	      that function). It gets passed a handler function(topic, payload) which
	      it invoked to handle incoming messages.

	Ensure Table, Map, Status show connection status to Websocket broker

console:
	DONE: config.js: bring to other config.js' format and consolidate
	DONE add small timestamp, if possible

	add "clear" button

map:
	DONE: config.js
	CSS for height of map
	DONE remove code for loading geofences and geo-fences.json

	add "follow this vehicle"
	add possibility for user to "save" current bounding box (i.e. map display size,position) and return to that

table:
	DONE config.js

tracks:
	DONE homogenize maps (mapbox, vs. OSM, etc.) with map/
	CSS, CSS, CSS, CSS!
	DONE Localtime on points

	DONE p/status.json: has to be configurable filename and/or replaced entirely.

status/bubbles:
	DONE: page with bubbles of all vehicles (red/green/yellow) start in blue.
	DONE click or hover for details of each
	status = 0: start by making light red; the longer the GW is on status 0,
	the darker the red gets.

tools:
	add manual note to a vehicle (e.g. is in repair); show in table
	display TID -> IMEI, reboot, sw versions in table
	geofence table / editor

backend:
	DONE collect /start info (IMEI, reboot time, sw version) for all GW.

o2s:
	DONE special MQTT topic (/o2s) to talk to o2s (configure):
	Allow giving individual topics higher ghash precision
	Ideas for monitor:
		nagios quiet tid
		track tid		-> track tid & write JSON to file (persist.py)
		untrack tid

	merge in o2db (fornax)
	allow remapping of topic to TID
		topic_tidmap = {
			'/jpm/5s' : 'JP',
		}
